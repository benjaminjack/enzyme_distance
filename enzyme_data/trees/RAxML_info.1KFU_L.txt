IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 23 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file phy/1KFU_L.phy.reduced

Alignment has 23 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 1940 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 71.46%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
